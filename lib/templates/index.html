I'm a [free and open source way](https://github.com/vzvenyach/htmldecks) to host professional slide decks.

I'm built using [Reveal.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and inspired by [Biggie](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie).

To use me, write slides in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and separate each slide with three dashes.
