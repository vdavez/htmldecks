# Using HTMLDecks

HTMLDecks is [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with slides separated by `---`. For example:

```
---
# This is a slide
---
This is *also* a slide
---
```
Once you're done editing the slides, create the deck and start presenting. Simply as that.

# About

This project is heavily inspired by [Reveal.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and [Biggie](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie). It's something I personally wanted to use, and I hope you enjoy it.
